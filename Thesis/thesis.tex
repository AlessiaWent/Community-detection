\chapter{Introduction}
The work presented in this thesis  has been performed within the collaboration among MHPC and the Analytic Solution Center (ASC), an office which is part of Assicurazioni Generali Head Office and is responsible of advanced analytic and big data projects. Generali proposed the overall topic: modelling of the customer database as a social network and community identification.  The Analytic Solution Center took also care to identify  such a large dataset within the company and its subsidaries. They finally identify the  Genertel (a subsidiary company of Generali) customer-base archive as the dataset to work on. The data have been first anonymized by Genertel and then the anonymized dataset has been delivered for the analysis.\\
The goal of the project is to implement on HPC resources a software able to detect the communities from the dataset identified.\\

The work performed will be presented in this document as follows.\\
In the rest of this chapter we will give a short introduction to Cluster Analysis and the most important related algorithms.\\
In chapter 2 we will describe the hardware and software architecture we implemented, and we will give more details about the two clustering algorithms we adopted in this work.\\
In chapter 3 we will describe the implementation on HPC platforms of our software architecture, and the whole ``optimization journey'' we performed.\\
Finally, in chapter 4 we will analyse the performance of our implementations, and the results obtained in terms of network communities identified.\\

The whole activity was co-supervised by Generali Big data group (dr. Valerio Consorti), which suggested for the greatest part the way to proceed. We remark that some deliverables has been submitted to Genertel and intermediate results were periodically discussed during several meetings.
\section{Introduction to Clustering}
\textit{Clustering}, or \textit{Cluster Analysis} is a collection of methods aimed at partitioning a set of \textit{objects} so that objects in the same subset are ``more similar'' to each other than to those in other subsets, according to some \textit{similarity} or \textit{dissimilarity} measure.\\
Throughout the document, given a set $D$ of objects, a similarity will be a symmetric function from $D\times D$ to $[0,1]$, while a dissimilarity or \textit{distance} will be a symmetric function $d$ from $D\times D$ to $[0,+\infty)$ such that
$$
d(x,y) = 0\Leftrightarrow x = y
$$
for all $x,y$ in $D$. If $d$ also satisfies the triangle inequality, it will be a \textit{metric} distance.\\

Cluster analysis is not a specific algorithm, but the general partitioning problem. In fact, there is not even a universal strict definition of what a cluster is. This leads to different cluster \textit{models}, into which numerous clustering algorithms are grouped.\\
Amongst the main models we have, for example, \textit{Hierarchical clustering}\cite{hie}, which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters, and is further divided into \textit{Agglomerative clustering} (bottom-up approach) and \textit{Divisive clustering} (top-down approach).\\
Or, we have $k$\textit{-means} and $k$\textit{-medoids} methods, where clusters are defined as subsets of points which are closest to their corresponding cluster \textit{center}, and the center of the clusters are found through minimization of an objective function (sum of the square distances).\\
The main drawback of this last class of clustering algorithms is that they are not able to detect clusters with an arbitrary shape. This is however achieved by algorithms based on \textit{local density}, which is the number of points within a threshold distance $\varepsilon$, that must be given as a parameter. This means that for each point we are only interested in the points which
are closest to him, therefore there is no problem, in principle, with using a distance function which is sometimes evaluated to $\infty$. Moreover, with both algorithms the number of clusters is determined automatically and does not need to be provided in advance (unlike in $k$-means).\\
Algorithms based on local density include DBSCAN\cite{db} and Density Peak\cite{dp}.\\

When $D$ is a set of vertices in a network and the definition of the similarity/dissimilarity measure involves the network structure (i.e. the set of edges and their weights) we talk about \textit{Community detection}. The general idea behind it is to form strongly linked subnetworks starting from the original network, and the weight of the edges between the different pairs of vertices defines a similarity measure.\\
Community detection can also by achieved by numerous classes of algorithms\cite{commdet}, but few are efficient enough to be used on a very large network. Among these, we have \emph{Label propagation} methods, where the main idea is that objects in the same community share the same \textit{label}, after labels are propagated according to the network structure.
\section{Cluster analysis on the given dataset}
The dataset we are working with is composed by Genertel customers, and each of the customers is provided with an $n$-tuple of \textit{features}. Such features have different types, they can be represented by real numbers, integers, strings or lists. Therefore, we are not able to use a \textit{standard} distance such as an $L^p$ distance in $\mathbb{R}^n$.\\
In the following, we will refer sometimes to customers as \textit{nodes} in the obtained network.\\
The idea is to assume that each feature $f$ contributes \textit{independently} with probability $p_f$ (which is defined for each $f$ individually) to the final link probability, and therefore that the final probability $p$ that two given individuals are linked is
$$
p =1-\prod_f(1-p_f).
$$
The probability above is then used as a similarity function.\\


Starting from the data referring to the last 6 months of the 20-years time period which is covered by the dataset, we proceed by analyzing bigger and bigger subsets of the dataset, investigating the evolution of the communities and of the patterns describing connections between customers/nodes. To this end, according to the similarity function above, we use two clustering algorithms. In order to use DBSCAN, we define a metric distance function which is compliant with the similarity function. In particular, the distance between two individuals is bigger when they are less similar according to the function $p$ above.\\
One possibility is to assume that $p_f$ is 0.99 (or some number which is very close to but less than 1) for each feature that indicates a ``deterministic'' link, and then define the distance $d$ as $-\log p$. In this case, $d$ satisfies the triangle inequality whenever, given individuals $A,B,C$ we have
$$
p_{A\leftrightarrow B}\cdot p_{B\leftrightarrow C} \leq p_{A\leftrightarrow C},
$$
which is a reasonable constraint for a probability function as above.\\

The second algorithm is Label propagation\cite{lp}, which requires the dataset to be first modeled as a network. We compare then the communities obtained by both algorithms for different subsets of the set of features.\\

\chapter{Methodologies and procedures}
In this chapter we will describe the basic elements and tools we used to perform our work. We will briefly describe the hardware architecture. We will then discuss the data structure and some preliminary work done on them. After that we will present the software implementation we performed, discussing our technical choices.\\
We will finally illustrate in detail the clustering algorithms that we considered. We remark here that our implementation choices were mostly dictated by the company's needs.
\section{The hardware facilities}
We developed our code and mostly worked, whenever possible, on the ELCID cluster, which is property of CNR-IOM. Otherwise, we worked on the COSILT (Amaro, UD, Italy) cluster.

\hline
COSILT & 10 & 24 & E5-2697 v2 Intel processor & 64 GB \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The table above summarizes the technical specification of the two infrastructures.
\section{The data}
The dataset we have been working with consists of the Genertel customers (car segment) spawning more than 20 years, for a total of 7.6M nodes. The database, originally stored in an Oracle DB, has been exported, anonymized and given to us in the form of 11 csv files.\\

The data contained in such files allow us to determine the features associated to each customer. Some features are associated to \textit{deterministic links}, i.e. similarity 0 or 1 between the pairs of customers. The features that are associated at first to a deterministic link are:
\begin{itemize}
\item credit card number,
\item agent code,
\item quotation number,
\item plate number.
\end{itemize}
All the features above are actually represented as lists, since each individual may register more than one credit card, ask for more than one estimate and so forth. For all the above, we are interested in knowing whether they are the same for the two individuals, or better if the intersection of the corresponding lists associated to the individuals are non-empty.\\
The features that are associated to a probabilistic link are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item e-mail address, which will be considered together with an estimated probability that the e-mail address is real 
\item phone number, same as above
\item e-mail domain, which will be considered whenever it refers to a company, or a workplace in general
\item address, which will be analyzed according to the distance between the two individuals, the population of their towns and their density
\item last name, which may indicate a family link whenever the two individuals are physically close to each other, depending on how much the last name is spread in that particular area
\item date of birth, also to be considered whenever the two individuals are physically close.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Address anonymization}
With regard to the addresses, the company proceeded with the anonymization using geocoding, i.e. given an address, they retrieved the correspondant latitude and longitude, ad then translated all the coordinates by the same vector. Such procedure is compatible with our analysis, since we only need the distance between the pairs of customers, in order to compute their similarity.\\
In the preliminary phase, we were also asked to check and verify the use of Google‚Äôs Geocoding API - a service which provides both geocoding and reverse geocoding - to anonymize the data. We therefore developed a Python script to fulfill such request.\\
The API can be accessed through an HTTP interface. To this end, one must first activate the API in their Google API Console\cite{cons}, then obtain credentials. The only option for credential in the case of Standard (free) plan is a server API key\cite{key}, which is provided with 1000 free requests per day. Unless specified otherwise, the same key can be used from different machines.\\

Since the API needed to process an input file with several millions of addresses, we checked whether the process could be parallelized, for example by splitting the file in advance and then starting a different independent process for each chunk of the file at the same time.\\
The first attempts were made in a 4-core laptop, using an input file with 100 addresses, GNU parallel, and the following Python code:
\begin{center}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python][basicstyle=\fontsize{26}]
import googlemaps
import time
import sys

gmaps = googlemaps.Client(key=MYKEY)

start = time.time()

with open(sys.argv[1]) as inputfile:
    for line in inputfile:
        geocode_result = gmaps.geocode(line)
        res = geocode_result[0][u'geometry'][u'location']
        print res[u'lat'],res[u'lng']

print("--- %s seconds ---" % (time.time() - start))

\end{lstlisting}
\end{center}
The program scaled very well up to this point: modulo fluctuations, it takes 32.5 seconds with one single process, 16.5 seconds with two processes and about 9 seconds with 4 processes.\\
The Python interface to the API requires the modules \textbf{googlemaps} and \textbf{requests}, both installed through \textbf{pip} in this case.\\
The program was later tested on ELCID and scaled just as well.
\section{Software implementation}\label{sec:impl}
Our software implementation was performed using the Python language. There are two main reasons for our choice:
\begin{itemize}
\item Having to deal with several deadlines, dictated by the company's needs, it was necessary to keep the developing time short enough
\item the company needed a final version of the codes in Python, in order to export them to their Cloud system.
\end{itemize}
We identified three main parts in our software implementation.\\
In the first part we read and process the input files, save the data we need into some data structures, and then compute the similarities/distances between the pairs of objects. This part has quadratic complexity, and it is the most expensive part of the program, therefore it runs in parallel.\\
The second part consists in running the clustering algorithm on the dataset we obtained. Since the elapsed time is negligible with respect to the rest of the program, there was no need for parallelization.\\
The third part consists in creating two output files containing some information about the clusters/communities that have been output by the algorithm, in order to profile them. All the requested information assumes that the dataset has been modeled into a network, regardless of the clustering algorithm, which may not require a network structure.\\
The first output file contains, for each object that ended up in a cluster (with more than one object), the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item cluster ID
\item degree within cluster
\item norm degree (degree within cluster/size of cluster)
\item closeness centrality within cluster
\item betweenness centrality within cluster
\item eigenvector centrality within cluster
\item PageRank centrality within cluster
\end{itemize}
Due to the computation of the centralities, the creation of this file has also quadratic complexity.\\

The second output file contains, for each cluster (with more than one object), the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item size
\item number of edges
\item average degree
\item maximum lenght of a shortest path between a pair of objects in the cluster
\item degree centralization
\end{itemize}
Due to the last two pieces of information, the creation of this file has also quadratic complexity. That is why the creation of the two files runs in parallel, too.\\
Given that most of the measures asked are strictly graph-related, we chose to use a library to manipulate our networks, igraph\cite{igr}. The documentation also provides a detailed decription of such measures.
\subsection{Dealing with graphs}
Not only provides igraph efficient data structures for representing graphs and related objects, but it also contains the implementation of many graph algorithms, including community detection algorithms such as Label propagation and optimized algorithms to compute several centrality measures.\\

igraph is open source and distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL. It was originally written in C, but can be embedded into higher level languages. In fact, it has also been developed as a Python extension module, and this is the form in which we use it.\\
Being part of the Python Package Index, it was installed through the \lstinline!pip! command.
\section{The clustering algorithms}
As we briefly anticipated previously, the goal is to compare a data clustering algorithm - therefore, not based on a network structure - and a community detection algorithm.
\subsection{Data clustering - DBSCAN}
As mentioned in the previous chapter, DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) is based on the concept of local density.\\
 The idea is the following: a \textit{core} point $p$ is a point with at least \textbf{minPts}  points within $\varepsilon$ (\textbf{minPts} is also to be given as parameter) and those points are said to be \textit{directly reachable} from $p$. A point $q$ is reachable from $p$ if there is a path $p=p_0\,p_1\,\cdots\,p_n=q$ such that $p_{i+1}$ is directly reachable from $p_i$ (so, in particular $p_i$ is a core point) for each $i$. Points which are not reachable from any point are considered noise. A core point will end up in the same cluster as all points which are reachable from it.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{DBSCAN}\label{alg:dbscan}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require dataset $D$, $\varepsilon > 0$, $m = $ minPts
\Function{regionQuery}{$p$,$\varepsilon$}
\State \Return all points in $p$'s $\varepsilon$-neighborhood
\EndFunction
\Function{expandCluster}{$p$, $neighPts$, $C$, $\varepsilon$, $m$}
\State add $p$ to cluster $C$
\For{point $p'$ in $neighPts$}
\If{$p'$ is not visited}
\State mark $p'$ as visited
\State $neighPts'\gets \Call{regionQuery}{p',\varepsilon}$
\If{size of $neighPts'\geq m$}
\State $neighPts\gets neighPts\cup neighPts'$
\EndIf
\EndIf
\If{$p'$ is not yet in any cluster}
\State add $p'$ to cluster $C$
\EndIf
\EndFor
\EndFunction
\Function{DBSCAN}{$D$, $\varepsilon$, $m$}
\State $C \gets 0$
\For{point $p$ in $D$}
\If{$p$ is visited}
\State \textbf{continue}
\EndIf
\State mark $p$ as visited
\State $neighPts\gets \Call{regionQuery}{p,\varepsilon}$
\If {size of $neighPts < m$}
\State mark $p$ as NOISE
\Else
\State $C\gets nextCluster$
\State $\Call{expandCluster}{p, neighPts, C, \varepsilon, m}$
\EndIf
\EndFor
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
Although DBSCAN may visit each point multiple times, its computational complexity is mostly determined by the number of \textsc{regionQuery} calls (see algorithm \ref{alg:dbscan}), which are exactly one per point. A meaningful value for $\varepsilon$ is such that on average $O(\log n)$ points are returned by each \textsc{regionQuery} call, therefore the average complexity is in this case given by $O(n\log n)$.\\

\textbf{minPts} must also be chosen carefully, otherwise DBSCAN will not be able to detect smaller clusters, or merge some of them that are supposed to be separate. In general, it is best if $\varepsilon$ and \textbf{minPts} are chosen by someone who knows the data very well.\\
There is no good choice for the parameters whenever the points in the dataset have large differences in density. Otherwise, DBSCAN is able to detect clusters of any shape.\\
The performance of DBSCAN obviously depends on the quality of the distance function, too.
\newpage
\subsection{Community detection - Label propagation}
Label propagation is a community detection algorithm that also works with networks where edges are weighted (unlike other such algorithms).\\

The main idea is the following: suppose that each of the neighbors of some node carries a label denoting the community to which its belong to. Then the node determines its community based on the labels of its neighbors, in particular it joins the community to which the maximum number of its neighbors belong to, with ties broken uniformly randomly.\\
At first each node is initialized with a unique label, then labels propagate at each step, until each node's label is the one which appears most frequently among its neighbors (or one of them, in case of ties).\\
Whenever the edges have weights, each neighbor counts as much as the weight of the edge connecting the it to the original node.\\

The update process is \textit{asynchronous}, meaning that if $C_x(t)$ represents the label given to node $x$ at step $t$, $x_0,\ldots,x_k$ are $x$'s neighbors and $x_0,\ldots,x_m$ (with $m\leq k$) are exactly the nodes that have already been visited at step $t$, then we have
$$
C_x(t) = f(C_{x_0}(t),\ldots,C_{x_m}(t),C_{x_{m+1}}(t-1),\ldots,C_{x_k}(t-1)),
$$
where $f$ returns the label occurring with the highest (weighted) frequency among neighbors.\\

The variation with \textit{synchronous} updates, i.e. such that
$$
C_x(t) = f(C_{x_0}(t-1),\ldots,C_{x_k}(t-1)),
$$
is closer to be discrete but has drawbacks, in particular it leads to oscillations in the presence of subnetworks which are bipartite or closer to be bipartite.
\begin{algorithm*}
\caption{Label propagation}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require network $N$
\For{node $x$ in $N$}
\State $t\gets 0$
\State $C_x(t)\gets x$
\EndFor
\Repeat
\State $t\gets t+1$
\State $X\gets$ random rearrangement of the order of the nodes
\For{$x$ in $X$}
\State update label asynchronously
\EndFor
\Until{every node has a label that the maximum number of its neighbors (counted with weights) has}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm*}

The initialization runs in $O(n)$ (linear) time. At each step, each node has to compute the maximum in a list of at most $d$ labels, where $d$ is its degree. Therefore, its label is updated in $O(d)$ time, for a total of $O(m$) time at each step, where $m$ is the number of edges. The algorithm is experimentally proven to converge in a few steps, and that the number of steps does not depend on $n$. Therefore, the overall time complexity is $O(m+n)$, near linear time.
\newpage
\chapter{Implementation}
In this chapter we will describe all the steps that we performed in order to reach the final software implementation on HPC platforms.\\

The first step was to write the Python software to deal with the program according to section \ref{sec:impl}.\\
We developed two Python scripts: the first one takes part of the dataset - according to the links we need to compute - as input, and outputs all the necessary information to describe the resulting graph (i.e. the pairs of nodes and corresponding weights defining the links). We call this action the \textit{Link generation}. This is indeed the most time-consuming part of the whole implementation. We will discuss in section \ref{sec:gen} the parallel implementation of this algorithm. The second script takes the obtained list of edges as input, together with the list of vertices (which is information contained in the dataset), performs either DBSCAN or Label propagation, and creates the two tables described in section  \ref{sec:impl}. We will discuss this in detail in section \ref{sec:tables}, \textit{Generation and profiling of the communities}.\\
As soon as we were able to access the dataset, we moved everything to the Lustre file system on ELCID. Before starting to work on the actual program, we spent some time to give a closer look at the dataset and try to figure out how to address the encountered issues. This took longer than expected.\\

In the next section we will explain in a bit more detail the analysis we performed in order to better understand how to use the dataset.
\section{Preliminary dataset analysis}
After a brief discussion with Generali, we concluded that our first goal was to compute the so-called \textbf{Broker} links, perform a clustering algorithm on the obtained network, and profile the communities. The idea behind the Broker link is that two people are connected whenever they have, at some point, interacted with the same agent in order to get an quotation for some policy.\\
The first thing we needed to understand was then how to determine when two quotations were given by the same agent, from the information contained in the dataset. In particular, one of the files defining the dataset gives information related to each quotation, including sometimes the agent code and/or the branch code.\\
We discussed possible ways to determine the probability that two customers were linked whenever the agent code information was missing for all the estimates asked by one of (or both) the customers. To this end we ran a few Python scripts to compute, for istance:
\begin{itemize}
\item how many estimates had both the agent code and the branch code information
\item how many branch codes were never associated to an agent code
\item how many agent codes were never associated to a branch code
\item for each agent code, the list of branch codes that were at least once associated to it.
\end{itemize}
We established a first definition of the Broker (probabilistic) link which used the above information.\\

Meanwhile, we tried to address the problem of missing information in the file containing personal/anagraphic information on the customers. We needed to use the (anonymized) fiscal code as a node-identifier but most customer IDs did not have that information. In order to find a possible way to retrieve a new fiscal code ID for at least some of the customers, we ran a few Python scripts in order to compute, for istance:
\begin{itemize}
\item how many customers without fiscal code information had information on name, date of birth or other data which normally defines the fiscal code
\item how many of them had a VAT number code (such customers would in fact be companies, and not physical persons)
\item whether any tuple \{name, date of birth, place of birth, gender\} was associated to more than one customer.
\end{itemize}
Given the not ideal results, we decided to stick to the customers who were provided with fiscal code information.\\
After further consultation with Genertel, we also decided to only consider estimates which were provided with an agent code, in order to define the Broker link.
\section{Link generation}\label{sec:gen}
In order to determine the list of edges according to any kind of link, we needed to read (part of the) file containing personal information on the customers. This is because the fiscal code ID had to be used as a node-identifier, so we needed to know which fiscal code ID each customer ID was mapped to. 
Moreover, within all our tests/attempts we selected a subset of the customers according to the time they were first registered in the database, and the file above also contains that kind of information.\\
The first results we were asked to provide Genertel concerned the network consisting of the customers who were first registered in the past six months (slightly less than 1 million customers), connected through the Broker links. Therefore, we did all our first attempts with the Broker links in mind.\\
In order to generate the Broker links we needed two more tables of the database: the first one maps each estimate to the people who were involved, and the second one maps each estimate to other information including the agent code (whenever present). The first part of the script is all about reading the input files and storing the needed data into well-suited dictionaries which were then used to define the \lstinline!Point! class:
\begin{center}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python][basicstyle=\fontsize{26}]
class Point(object):
    def __init__(self, name, rolesdict, entdict):
        self.name = name
        self.ent = rolesdict[self.name]
        self.ci = []
        for e in self.ent:
            try:
                if entdict[e] != '':
                    self.ci.append(entdict[e])
            except KeyError:
                pass
    def link(self, other):
        listci = [a for a in self.ci if a in other.ci]
        if len(listci):
            return 1

\end{lstlisting}
\end{center}
The \lstinline!link! method of the class returns the weight of the link (whenever present) between two \lstinline!Point!s.\\

Once the set of points is defined, we need to compute the links between them. Given their amount, the computation must be parallelized.
\subsection{First attempt of parallelization}
Our first attempt of parallelization involved the \lstinline!pp! (Parallel Python) library\cite{pp} . We only needed to compute, in fact, the upper-triangular part of the adjacency matrix, since the graph is not oriented, and the work was divided between the processes according to the Figure \ref{fig:old}.
%\vspace{5 mm}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=8.415 cm,width=11.25 cm]{old.png}
\caption{Case of 24 processors, as in one COSILT node. Each color corresponds to one thread}\label{fig:old}
\end{figure}
The width of the slices varies so that each thread performs the same amount of computations. Memory consumption is however not balanced: the last process (assuming processes are numbered from left to right) needs to know everything about all customers - therefore, it consumes a lot of memory - while the first one only needs to know the data concerning a small subset of the customers.\\
At the end of the computation, one single process collects all the results and does the actual writing to the output file.\\

We performed two different kinds of measure: we first measured scalability fixing the number of customers and increasing the number of processes, then fixing the number of processes to the maximum (24 when using COSILT, 64 for ELCID) and increasing the number of customers.
 \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=7.0 cm,width=10 cm]{label_200K.png}
\caption{Scalability on a node of the COSILT cluster, elapsed time is expressed in seconds}\label{fig:200}
\end{figure}
The computation scales almost perfectly with the number of process, as Figure \ref{fig:200}.\\

 \begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=7.0 cm,width=10 cm]{24coresb.png}
\caption{Scalability on a full node of the COSILT cluster, elapsed time is expressed in seconds}\label{fig:problem}
\end{figure}
The scalability with respect the size of the network seems to be quadratic (as it should be). However, we were not able to complete the computation for 1 million customers within the expected amount of time according to Figure \ref{fig:problem}.\\

Parallel Python copies everything which is needed by the different threads,
so the memory occupation grows a lot with the number of threads.
Therefore, the number of threads (together with the size of the network) is
actually a bottleneck. Indeed, we were only able to analyse up to 500 thousand customers using one full ELCID node (64 cores) without filling up its RAM, less than the 700 thousands we were able to analyse on a COSILT node (24 cores).\\
\subsection{Final shared memory parallelization}
For the final implementation, we switched then to the \lstinline!multiprocessing! library. Despite being normally a little less efficient than Parallel Python,
\lstinline!multiprocessing! solves the memory problem, being able to work with
shared memory.\\

Switching to a different library is not the only thing that changed in our implementation. In fact, we also changed the distribution among processes:
\begin{figure}[H]\label{fig:blocks}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=8.415 cm,width=11.25 cm]{grid.png}
\caption{Case of 24 processors, as in one COSILT node. Each color corresponds to one thread}
\end{figure}
The adjacency matrix was divided into blocks of size around $10000\times 10000$ (a bit less in some cases, depending on the remainder of the division \{size of the matrix\}/10000), and processes have to analyse the upper-triangular blocks. The number of cores is always an upper bound for the number of blocks analysed at the same time. Therefore, in the case of a COSILT node, the first 24 blocks are assigned to the 24 processes, as soon as a process completes its job it takes care of the next block that must be analysed, and so forth. After this change, processes are also balanced in memory.\\

The block size was chosen so that each process takes a ``reasonable'' amount of time (about 4 minutes in the case of Broker links), meaning that processes do not need to be reassigned too often, and at the same time there is no memory-related issue.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=7.0 cm,width=10 cm]{24cores_shared.png}
\caption{Scalability on a full node of the COSILT cluster, elapsed time is expressed in seconds}\label{fig:shared}
\end{figure}
As Figure \ref{fig:shared} shows, we were able to run the script for the entire network consisting of 1 million customers.\\

The elapsed time for this Python script is obviously dependent on the type of link we have to analyse.\\
Normally - at least in the deterministic case - in order to determine whether two customers are linked we have to compare lists and check whether they have any intersection, and the length of these lists is highly variable depending on what they represent.\\

Sometimes more than one type of link must be used in order to build the network. This is never a problem, since if the definition of the link becomes too complicated one can just run the script once for each type of link and then merge the output files, provided that the graph which is later obtained through the second Python script is simplified (i.e. multiple links are removed) - more about it in the next section.\\

After trying a few runs with the other deterministic links, given that the maximum time that can be asked for a run on a COSILT node is 48 hours, we concluded that 1 million is a good size for a network to be analysed by one single shared-memory node.
\subsection{Inter-node parallelization}
Due to the fact that the entire dataset consists however of over 7 million customers, it is clearly needed to perform a further parallelization level including more than one node.
 \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=7.0 cm,width=10 cm]{division.png}
\caption{Example for 2 million customers}
\end{figure}
Our parallel approach consisted in splitting the adjacency matrix over multiple nodes. The matrix is divided into blocks of size around 1 million$\times$ 1 million, and each node takes care of one block in the diagonal just as we described so far in the single node case with 1 million customers. As for the other blocks in the upper-triangular part, they need to be split in two parts for memory reasons, and this way they perform the same amount of computations as the blocks in the diagonal. The number of nodes we need to complete the computation for $n$ million customers is therefore
$$
n+n(n-1) = n^2.
$$
After each node is done with its block, the output files only need to be merged. This means that, if an arbitrarily high number of nodes were available, the time needed to compute all edges within a graph with over 1 million vertices would be the same as the 1 million case.
\section{Generation and profiling of the communities}\label{sec:tables}
The second Python script makes large use of the igraph library. After reading the vertices file, it creates a graph with exactly those vertices, using the fiscal code as a name for each vertex. After that, it reads the edges file while storing the edges and corresponding weights in separate lists, with the purpose of adding all edges to the graph at the same time. This is simply because it is a lot more efficient with igraph to add all edges at once (whenever there are ``many'' of them).\\

Then, the clustering algorithm is applied. In the case of Label propagation, the algorithm is already implemented in the library, while DBSCAN was implemented manually through a class. The way DBSCAN is used in our program basically means that a core point is a point with at least \textbf{minPts} neighbors connected to it through edges with weight greater than a fixed $r>0$, and those neighbors are precisely the points directly reachable from it. Therefore, in the DBSCAN case, we could simply only add the edges with weight greater than $r$ and define the class as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python][basicstyle=\fontsize{26}]
class DBSCAN(object):
    def __init__(self, minPts, g):
        self.minPts = minPts
        self.graph = g
        self.npoints = g.vcount()
        self.it = iter(range(self.npoints))
        self.clusters = []
    def createCluster(self, p):
        p["group"] = self.it.next()
        self.clusters.append([p])
    def expandCluster(self, c):
        for p in c:
            if p["checked"] != None:
                continue
            if len(self.graph.neighbors(p.index)) >= self.minPts:
                for j in self.graph.neighbors(p.index):
                    q = self.graph.vs()[j]
                    if q["group"] == None:
                        q["group"] = p["group"]
                        c.append(q)
            p["checked"] = 1
\end{lstlisting}
\end{center}
The \lstinline!group! attribute of a vertex defines the cluster it belongs to, and it is set as soon as a point is visited by the algorithm.\\

The clustering algorithm is then followed by the production of the two output files described in the previous section. This last part was also parallelized. In both cases, we have to compute graph-related measures within the obtained clusters, therefore the overall computation consists of a loop over the clusters. We divided the computation so that each process takes care of the same amount of clusters, and measured the scalability in the Label propagation case, fixing the number of processes and varying the number of customers (using the Broker links):
  \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=6.125 cm,width=8.75 cm]{24cores_table1.png}
\caption{Scalability on a full node of the COSILT cluster for the first output file with Label propagation, elapsed time is expressed in seconds} \label{fig:tab1}
\end{figure}
 \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=6.125 cm,width=8.75 cm]{24cores_table4.png}
\caption{Scalability on a full node of the COSILT cluster for the second output file with Label propagation, elapsed time is expressed in seconds} \label{fig:tab4}
\end{figure}
Overall, we notice that the time taken by the generation and profiling of the communities is definitely not negligible with respect to the time taken by the generation of the links. However, it is less.
Moreover, such part can trivially be split in two parts, each of which performs the same clustering algorithm independently and produces one of the two output files. This means that the overall computation can additionally benefit from this further trivial parallelization, and that the total time taken only depends on the creation of the slowest of the output tables.\\

According to Figures \ref{fig:tab1} and \ref{fig:tab4}, scalability is quadratic on the number of customers. These preliminary scalability tests, nevertheless, do not explain the situation very accurately. In fact, given the computations involved, the elapsed time is highly dependent on the size of the obtained communities. Computational complexity is (in both cases) not $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of customers, but rather 
$$
\sum_{\text{communities}}|\text{size of community}|^2.
$$
The bottleneck is then the size of the biggest community and the corresponding process takes inevitably longer than the others to complete its computations.\\
In the Broker case, customers are connected whenever thay have interacted with the same agent. In the entire dataset relatively few (tens of thousands) agent codes appear, and few people have interacted with more than one agent. Therefore, we expect clusters to be ``grouped'' by one single agent. It is also not strange that all (or most) agent codes appear within the 1-million - or less - subset of customers, given their number. Summing up everything, it is probably the case that in the Broker case the ratio $n/$\{size of greatest community\} does not vary too much with $n$, therefore the apparent $O(n^2)$ complexity. This is however highly dependent on the type of link.
\chapter{Results obtained with the clustering algorithms}
In this chapter we will show some results obtained with our clustering algorithms concerning the following links:
\begin{itemize}
\item Broker links
\item Credit Card links
\item Plate links
\item E-mail links
\end{itemize}
As previously mentioned, the first results we were asked to provide concerned the Broker link for the 1 million customers registered in the past six months. The main purpose was to test both clustering algorithms and compare them. For our first runs with DBSCAN, we set \textbf{minPts} to 15. As for $\varepsilon$ there is no real choice in the case of deterministic links: we have to include all neighbors in the graph in order to compute the local density.\\

The results are rather different with the two algorithms:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{||c|c|c||}
\hline
 \phantom{0} & DBSCAN & Label propagation \\ 
\hline
communities & 191 & 1373 \\
\hline
communities with more than 15 nodes & 191 & 494 \\
\hline
nodes in communities & 63020 & 67438 \\
\hline
max size & 55128 & 4207 \\
\hline
min size & 16 & 2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The huge community found by DBSCAN is definitely not represented by one single agent code. Indeed, in order to merge two of them it is sufficient that one customers has interacted with both and has at least 15 neighbors in total (which is true in most cases). Of course we could try to increase the value of \textbf{minPts} heavily, however in that case there would be many more agents not forming any community. This is in fact an example of bad performance of DBSCAN in the case of high variations in local density.\\
Label propagation found a much higher number of communities because most of them are very small (2 or 3 customers). It is not theoretically impossible for DBSCAN to find clusters of size less than \textbf{minPts}, but it would be strange if it did in this case, given how the links are defined.\\

Figure \ref{fig:nnodes1} shows the distribution of the community size if we only consider cluster of size between 15 and 400. The main difference between the two outputs is due to the huge community found by DBSCAN, which is not considered here.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=7.25 cm,width=10 cm]{plot_nnodes_broker.png}
\caption{Distribution of community size among communities}\label{fig:nnodes1}
\end{figure}
The difference between the two outputs also results in more internally interconnected communities in the case of Label propagation, being the communities smaller on average and not subjected to ``undesired merging''. This can be easily observed from the distribution of the norm degrees in the two cases, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ndegree1}.
  \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=7.25 cm,width=10 cm]{plot_net_ndegree_broker.png}
\caption{Distribution of norm degree within community among nodes}\label{fig:ndegree1}
\end{figure}
The second output file provides the degree centralization for each community, that is a measure of how central is the most central vertex (with respect to the degree centrality) compared to the other vertices. For both algorithms, in most communities this centralization is close to 0: all customers have about the same role within the community, as expected given the type of link.
  \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=7.25 cm,width=10 cm]{plot_net_centralization_broker.png}
\caption{Distribution of centralization among communities}

\end{figure}
As another example, we will show now the results obtained using the Credit Card link, i.e. two people are connected if and only if they share a credit card number. As expected, a lot less customers are part of some cluster in this case, and communities are smaller on average.
 \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{||c|c|c||}
\hline
 \phantom{0} & DBSCAN & Label propagation \\ 
\hline
communities & 71 & 1080 \\
\hline
communities with more than 15 nodes & 71 & 96 \\
\hline
nodes in communities & 4169 & 7317 \\
\hline
max size & 443 & 278 \\
\hline
min size & 16 & 2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Extending the computation to all the customers registered in the past year (almost 2 million) the results are the following:
 \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{||c|c|c||}
\hline
 \phantom{0} & DBSCAN & Label propagation \\ 
\hline
communities & 119 & 2762 \\
\hline
communities with more than 15 nodes & 119 & 216 \\
\hline
nodes in communities & 11445 & 18311 \\
\hline
max size & 3713 & 598 \\
\hline
min size & 16 & 2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The behavior is similar when restricting to communities of size between 15 and 100:
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=7.25 cm,width=10 cm]{plot_nnodes_ccred_1y.png}
\caption{Distribution of community size among communities}
\end{figure}
 In this example we can also notice that communities are smaller and more interconnected with Label propagation, but the difference between the two algorithms is smaller compared to the Broker example.
  \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=7.25 cm,width=10 cm]{plot_net_ndegree_ccred_1y.png}
\caption{Distribution of norm degree within community among nodes}
\end{figure}
The peak at 0.5 is due to the high number of communities of size 2.\\
Overall, we can see that DBSCAN has still a non-ideal behavior - after all the function we are using as a distance is not a metric - since it merges too much and finds very big clusters. However the situation is not as dramatic as the Broker case, also because the local densities of the points in this case are not as unbalanced.\\

The Plate links (two people are connected if and only if they share a plate number) led to a similar behavior for both algorithms after we filtered the presumably fake plate numbers, found in a list that we were given by Genertel.\\

Given the results so far, we decided together with Generali to stick to Label propagation for the following runs. In order to better understand the meaning of the Broker links and the way different links interact, we were asked to run the first script a few times using the Credit Card link as deterministic and the Broker link as probabilistic with some fixed probability $p < 1$. The results were the following:
 \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{||c|c|c|c||}
\hline
 \phantom{0} & $p = 0.5$ & $p = 0.1$ & $p = 0.01$\\ 
\hline
communities & 2112 & 2145 & 3963 \\
\hline
nodes in communities & 72002 & 72005 & 72003\\
\hline
max size & 4207 & 4210 & 4283\\
\hline
min size & 2 & 2 & 2\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The number of customers who are part of some community is basically always the same. Given the results for the Broker and Credit Card links separately, we may conclude that almost all customers who have at least one neighbor in the network end up in some community (this is technically always true with Label propagation if we also count communities of size 1, but here we are not considering them).\\

The last link we were able to examine was the E-mail link (two people are connected if and only if they share an e-mail). Unlike the Plates case, it is hard to tell whether an e-mail is fake given the data, therefore we were not able to use a similar filter, and the links obtained were a lot more:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{||c|c|c|c||}
\hline
 \phantom{0} & E-mail & E-mail+Plates & E-mail+Plates+Credit Card\\ 
\hline
communities & 41921 & 75892 & 75427 \\
\hline
nodes in communities & 243747 & 303770 & 298478\\
\hline
max size & 18744 & 18753 & 18753\\
\hline
min size & 2 & 2 & 2\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\chapter{Conclusions}
In this last chapter we briefly summarize the activities performed within this thesis, underlining the most important achievements we reached. The overall goal of the thesis described in the Introduction has been achieved. In particular, we implemented on HPC resources cluster algorithms able to process and evaluate communities on the dataset provided. The usage of HPC resources allowed us to process and analyse an amount of data several times larger than the amount of data Genertel is able to process internally.\\

The main results of the thesis concern two important aspects, the HPC implementation and the Cluster analysis.\\

From the HPC implementation point of view:
\begin{itemize}
\item We implemented an intra-node parallelization by means of a shared memory approach
\item We implemented an inter-node parallelization
\item The total amount of HPC resources used is more than 77000 core-hours. This means 855 jobs submitted so far
\item We parallelized and measured speed-up of the tools developed within the node and on a multinode infrastructure
\end{itemize}
Our implementation is able in principle to deal with arbitrarily large datasets for all kinds of links. However, we did not extend all the computations to the entire dataset for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item Genertel was more interested in analysing different kinds of links on smaller subsets (mostly 1 or 2 million customers) than analysing one single link on the whole dataset
\item The HPC resources available to us are shared with other users, which did not allow us to complete all the jobs in a sufficiently small amount of time
\end{itemize}
With respect to clustering algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
\item We generated communities for different kinds of links 
\item We compared two algorithms for the generation of such communities
\end{itemize}


Given the limited amount of time, we were only able to analyse only some of the links, mostly deterministic ones.\\
In order to complete the work, the following has to be done:
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete the analysis for all the probabilistic links independently
\item Complete the analysis for all the links together
\item Extend the analysis to the complete dataset consisting of 7.6 million customers
\end{itemize}
